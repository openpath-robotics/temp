    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Daisy Chain Project Overview
========================================================================

This is a simple example of how to connect two MotionCam-3D devices into a daisy
chain setup - when they trigger scanning on each other sequentially.

You will learn how to:

* check if you have appropriate devices available,
* how to set up devices for a successful daisy chain.

For more information about how to set up daisy chain wiring see device manual
